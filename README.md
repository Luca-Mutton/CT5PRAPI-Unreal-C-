# CT5PRAPI-Unreal-C++
CT5PRAPI Unreal C++: This was project that I worked on for one of my modules called Programming Application Programming Interfaces where I had to work with an API to demonstrate in a small demo what I learnt whilst using that program. This demo is a first person shooter where the player will control a character to shoot the cube objects in the level and every time the projectile hits, the cubes will get smaller until it disappears and with every hit, the object will change colour as well. 
This was made by implementing C++ from visual studios into Unreal Engine that involves how the object changes colour based on if the projectile hits the cube and also when the objects disappears from the level depending on the size it is at.
